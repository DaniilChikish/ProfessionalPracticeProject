You have coped well with the first task and are ready for real battle.
Our sensors detected a way out of the subspace of a group of enemy bombers near the planetoid on the border of the system.
You must intercept and destroy the ships before they reload the engines and make a jump to our rear.
Unfortunately, we can give you only one squad of exterminators and the reconnaissance ship. All our forces are involved in the battle at the front.
Be careful, there is information that the bombers are armed with the latest cluster torpedoes "Sprut".
