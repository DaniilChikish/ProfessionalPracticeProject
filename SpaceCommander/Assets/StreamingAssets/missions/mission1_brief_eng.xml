In the NGS-42-alpha nebula, our avant-garde stumbled upon a group of ships of the corporation "Red" Our forces defeated the enemy, but several sabotage ships retreated and disappeared into the asteroid belt.

Your first task: Find and destroy the remaining enemy.
Under your leadership there will be a squad of scout-interceptors.
You don't need to nurse them. Each of them is able to protect for himself.
You will need to coordinate the movement of your ships to accomplish the task.

You can not be afraid to fail this task. If necessary, we will send reinforcements.
